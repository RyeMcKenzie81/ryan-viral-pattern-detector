When she and her mother were against her dad &amp; sidelined him because he didn't approve the marriage, where were you???

Don't tell me nothing about failed parenting.

She's not the first child actress that was exposed to fame

Her mum ruined her.

> @ahrtmad If kids never cross his mind when he talks about the future, it’s a glimpse into how little he’s thought about the weight of fatherhood. Most men expect a woman to do the parenting for them. A person who genuinely sees themselves as a future parent plans with that role in mind.

Just be honest with yourself. Don't become a parent if you're not sincere.
