## Must-Have (Required)

These are needed to start onboarding. Without them we can't run any of the automated analysis.

| # | Item | Example / Notes |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Brand name** | Exactly as it should appear in ads |
| 2 | **Website URL** | Main brand site (we auto-scrape tagline, benefits) |
| 3 | **Facebook Page URL** | `facebook.com/yourbrand` — needed for ad scraping |
| 4 | **Facebook Ad Library URL** | Search your brand at `facebook.com/ads/library`, copy the results URL |
| 5 | **At least 1 product name** | Each distinct product we'll be creating ads for |

## Highly Recommended

These unlock the most powerful parts of onboarding — automated ad analysis, Amazon review mining, and competitor intelligence.

### Per Product

| # | Item | Why We Need It |
|---|------|----------------|
| 6 | **Product URL** | Main product/sales page on your site |
| 7 | **Amazon product URL** | We scrape listing images, reviews, and product details automatically |
| 8 | **Landing page URLs NOT in active ads** | We auto-discover landing pages from their ad library — only need URLs for funnels they're *not* currently running ads to (new pages, paused campaigns, etc.) |
| 9 | **Product dimensions & weight** | Width, height, depth, weight — used in ad copy and compliance |
| 10 | **Product description** | 2-3 sentences — what it is and what it does |

### Brand-Level

| # | Item | Why We Need It |
|---|------|----------------|
| 11 | **Brand voice / tone description** | How should ads sound? Casual, clinical, urgent, friendly? |
| 12 | **Logo** (high-res PNG) | For asset generation and brand consistency |
| 13 | **Compliance restrictions** | Any claims they CAN'T make (FDA, FTC, platform policies) |
| 14 | **Required disclaimers** | Legal text that must appear on certain ads |
| 15 | **Ad Account ID** | Meta ad account ID — needed if we're publishing ads on their behalf |

### Target Audience

| # | Item | Why We Need It |
|---|------|----------------|
| 16 | **Pain points** | Top 3-5 problems their customers face |
| 17 | **Desires / goals** | What their customers want to achieve |
| 18 | **Demographics** (if known) | Age range, gender skew, interests — helps with persona creation |

### Competitors

| # | Item | Why We Need It |
|---|------|----------------|
| 19 | **Competitor names** (2-3) | Direct competitors in their space |
| 20 | **Competitor Facebook Ad Library URLs** | We scrape and analyze their ads for messaging intel |
| 21 | **Competitor Amazon URLs** | We mine their reviews for pain points and language |
| 22 | **Competitor website URLs** | For landing page analysis |

## Nice-to-Have (Can Fill Later)

These can be gathered after the initial call or extracted automatically by the tool.

- **Sample hooks** they've used before (headlines, subject lines)
- **Past ad performance data** (which angles worked, which didn't)
- **Customer testimonials or reviews** (outside Amazon)
- **Mechanism name** — if they have a branded mechanism (e.g., "CryoSlim Technology")
- **UMP / UMS** — Unique Mechanism Problem and Solution (we can extract these from landing pages)

---

## What Happens During Onboarding

Here's what the tool does with everything above — so clients understand the value of coming prepared:

1. **Brand Basics** — We enter brand info and auto-scrape their website for tagline/benefits
2. **Facebook/Meta** — We scrape their ad library, group ads by destination URL (auto-discovering their landing pages), and run AI analysis to extract messaging patterns (hooks, pain points, benefits) from each group. Each landing page becomes an offer variant automatically.
3. **Products** — For each product we scrape Amazon (images + reviews), and build out the full product profile. Offer variants from step 2 are linked here.
4. **Competitors** — We scrape competitor ads and Amazon listings, extracting their messaging strategy for competitive intelligence

The more URLs and info they bring, the more the AI can extract automatically. A well-prepared client can be fully onboarded in a single session.
