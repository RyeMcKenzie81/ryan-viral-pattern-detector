# 5 Levels of Consumer Awareness (Eugene Schwartz)

Eugene Schwartz's "Breakthrough Advertising" framework defines 5 levels of consumer awareness that determine how to approach advertising messaging. Understanding which level your audience is at helps craft the right message.

## Level 1: Unaware
**Definition**: The prospect doesn't know they have a problem, need, or desire.

**Characteristics**:
- No awareness of the problem your product solves
- Not actively looking for solutions
- May not even realize they're missing out on something

**Ad Approach**:
- Lead with story, curiosity, or entertainment
- Educate about the problem first
- Use pattern interrupts to get attention
- Cannot sell directly - must build awareness first

**Example Hooks**:
- "Most people don't realize this is happening to them..."
- "Here's something nobody talks about..."
- Story-driven content that reveals a problem

---

## Level 2: Problem Aware
**Definition**: The prospect knows they have a problem but doesn't know solutions exist.

**Characteristics**:
- Feels the pain/frustration
- May have accepted the problem as "normal"
- Not actively searching for solutions
- Doesn't know what to look for

**Ad Approach**:
- Agitate the problem (make them feel it)
- Show them they're not alone
- Introduce the concept of a solution category
- Bridge from problem to solution awareness

**Example Hooks**:
- "Tired of [problem]? There's actually a reason for that..."
- "If you're dealing with [symptom], here's what's really going on..."
- "I struggled with this for years until I discovered..."

---

## Level 3: Solution Aware
**Definition**: The prospect knows solutions exist but doesn't know YOUR product specifically.

**Characteristics**:
- Actively or passively researching options
- Comparing different approaches
- May have tried other solutions that didn't work
- Skeptical but open

**Ad Approach**:
- Differentiate your solution from alternatives
- Address why other solutions fail
- Introduce your unique mechanism
- Build credibility for your approach

**Example Hooks**:
- "Most [solutions] don't work because they miss this one thing..."
- "The difference between this and everything else..."
- "Why [common approach] is making things worse..."

---

## Level 4: Product Aware
**Definition**: The prospect knows your product but hasn't bought yet.

**Characteristics**:
- Has seen your ads or visited your site
- On the fence about purchasing
- May have objections or concerns
- Needs final push or reassurance

**Ad Approach**:
- Address specific objections
- Social proof (testimonials, reviews, results)
- Risk reversal (guarantees, free trials)
- Urgency/scarcity (when authentic)
- Answer "why now?" and "why from you?"

**Example Hooks**:
- "Here's what [Customer Name] experienced after 30 days..."
- "The #1 concern people have before trying this..."
- "Why I almost didn't launch this product..."

---

## Level 5: Most Aware
**Definition**: The prospect knows your product, believes it works, and is ready to buy.

**Characteristics**:
- Previous customers or warm leads
- Just needs the right offer or timing
- High intent, low friction needed
- May be waiting for a deal

**Ad Approach**:
- Lead with the offer
- Simple, direct messaging
- Price-focused if running promotions
- Remind them why they wanted it
- Create urgency for action

**Example Hooks**:
- "Back in stock - 20% off this week only"
- "Last chance: Sale ends tonight"
- "[Product Name] - You know you want it"
- Direct offer with minimal persuasion needed
