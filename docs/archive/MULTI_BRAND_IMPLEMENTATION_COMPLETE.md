# Multi-Brand Product-Aware Video Analysis - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Production Ready
**Phase:** 4d - Multi-Brand Schema & Testing

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented and tested multi-brand product-aware video analysis system. The system can now analyze viral videos with specific product context and generate production-ready adaptation scripts.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Schema Enhancements

**File:** `sql/migration_multi_brand_schema.sql`

#### Added to `video_analysis` table:
```sql
-- Link analysis to specific product
product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

-- Store AI-generated product adaptations
product_adaptation JSONB
```

#### Created `product_scripts` table:
```sql
-- Script versioning and management
CREATE TABLE product_scripts (
    -- Relationships
    product_id UUID NOT NULL,
    brand_id UUID NOT NULL,
    source_video_id UUID,
    video_analysis_id UUID,
    parent_script_id UUID,  -- For revisions

    -- Script content
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    script_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    script_structure JSONB,

    -- Production planning
    estimated_duration_sec INTEGER,
    production_difficulty VARCHAR(20),
    required_props JSONB,
    required_locations JSONB,
    talent_requirements TEXT,

    -- AI tracking
    generated_by_ai BOOLEAN,
    ai_model VARCHAR(100),
    ai_prompt TEXT,

    -- Viral patterns
    source_viral_patterns JSONB,
    target_viral_score FLOAT,

    -- Version control
    version_number INTEGER,
    is_current_version BOOLEAN,

    -- Performance tracking
    produced_post_id UUID,
    actual_views INTEGER,
    actual_engagement_rate FLOAT
);
```

#### Bug Fixes:
```sql
-- Added missing constraint for upsert operations
ALTER TABLE video_processing_log
ADD CONSTRAINT video_processing_log_post_id_key UNIQUE (post_id);
```

---

### 2. Updated Video Analyzer

**File:** `viraltracker/analysis/video_analyzer.py`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added support for `product_id` column
- ✅ Added support for `product_adaptation` JSONB column
- ✅ Removed temporary workaround code
- ✅ Updated to save product adaptations to database

**Key Method:**
```python
def _save_analysis(self, post_id: str, product_id: Optional[str], ...):
    record = {
        "post_id": post_id,
        "product_id": product_id,  # NEW
        "hook_transcript": hook.get("transcript"),
        # ... other fields ...
        "product_adaptation": json.dumps(product_adaptation),  # NEW
    }

    self.supabase.table("video_analysis").insert(record).execute()
```

---

### 3. Product Adaptation Structure

**AI-Generated Product Adaptations Include:**

```json
{
  "how_this_video_style_applies": "Explanation of viral pattern application",

  "adaptation_ideas": [
    "Idea 1: Specific concept",
    "Idea 2: Alternative approach",
    "Idea 3: Creative variation"
  ],

  "script_outline": "Full script with timing:\nHook (0-5s): ...\nMontage (5-15s): ...\nClimax (15-25s): ...\nCTA (25-27s): ...",

  "key_differences": "What needs to change from original",

  "target_audience_fit": "9/10 because [detailed reasoning]",

  "estimated_production_difficulty": "medium",

  "required_props_or_setup": [
    "Yakety Pack cards",
    "Family setting",
    "Gaming setup"
  ]
}
```

## Architecture

### Product-Aware Analysis Flow

```
1. User runs: vt analyze videos --project X --product Y

2. VideoAnalyzer loads product context:
   - Product name, description
   - Target audience
   - Key problems solved
   - Features and benefits
   - Custom context prompt

3. Gemini analyzes video WITH product context:
   - Understands product positioning
   - Identifies applicable viral patterns
   - Generates product-specific adaptations

4. Results saved to database:
   - video_analysis.product_id = product UUID
   - video_analysis.product_adaptation = full JSON

5. Optional: Create formal script record:
   - Save to product_scripts table
   - Track versions and revisions
```

### Multi-Product Support

**Same video, multiple products:**
```bash
# Analyze for Product A
vt analyze videos --project insta --product product-a

# Analyze same videos for Product B
vt analyze videos --project insta --product product-b

# Compare which product fits better
```

**Database tracks:**
- Multiple analyses per video (different products)
- Product-specific adaptations for each
- Audience fit scores for comparison

---

## Script Versioning System

### product_scripts Table Features

**Version Control:**
- `parent_script_id` - Links to previous version
- `version_number` - Incremental version tracking
- `is_current_version` - Flag for latest version
- `version_notes` - Change documentation

**Production Planning:**
- `estimated_duration_sec` - Target video length
- `production_difficulty` - easy|medium|hard
- `required_props` - JSON array of needed items
- `required_locations` - JSON array of settings
- `talent_requirements` - Who needs to be in video

**AI Tracking:**
- `generated_by_ai` - Boolean flag
- `ai_model` - Which model generated it
- `ai_prompt` - Original prompt used
- `ai_generation_params` - Temperature, etc.

**Performance Tracking:**
- `produced_post_id` - If video was made
- `actual_views` - Real performance
- `actual_engagement_rate` - Actual engagement
- `performance_vs_prediction` - How accurate was AI

**Viral Pattern Tracking:**
- `source_viral_patterns` - Which patterns used
- `target_viral_score` - Predicted viral score

## Example Product Adaptation

### Source Video: "Nursery Makeover" (8.5/10 viral)

**Original Pattern:**
- POV: First baby never got nursery → go all out for big girl room
- Before & After transformation
- DIY montage with emotional payoff

**Yakety Pack Adaptation:**

**How Style Applies:**
> "The 'Problem → Effort/Montage → Solution/Emotional Payoff' structure is highly adaptable. Frame screen time battles as 'Before' state, product purchase/usage as 'Effort/Montage,' resulting connection as satisfying 'After' reveal."

**Adaptation Ideas:**
1. **Communication Room Makeover** - Transform gaming space into family discussion nook with Yakety Pack as centerpiece
2. **Emotional Nursery** - "We gave her a perfect physical room, but hadn't built the emotional connection yet"
3. **DIY Quality Time** - Build special table/spot specifically for card usage

**Script (27 seconds):**
```
Hook (0-5s):
  Child intensely gaming, ignoring parent
  Text: "POV: We fixed screen time fights with a fancy room...
         but forgot to fix the conversation gap."

Montage (5-15s):
  Parent frustrated
  Parent finds/orders Yakety Pack
  Quick shots: reading instructions, shuffling cards

Climax/Solution (15-25s):
  Family sitting together, using the cards
  Show genuine laughter and focused conversation
  Child willingly puts controller down to join chat

CTA (25-27s):
  Text overlay: "Shop the communication solution"
  Link in bio
```

**Key Difference:**
> "Original focuses on physical labor and decor; adapted version focuses on emotional labor and communication tools. 'After' state is not just a room, but a shift in family dynamic."

**Audience Fit:** 9/10
> "Targets parents invested in child's well-being. Age alignment perfect (original for 6yo, Yakety Pack for 6-15). Emotional stakes (parental guilt/redemption) resonate with target demographic struggling with screen time."

## CLI Commands

### Product-Aware Analysis
```bash
# Analyze videos with product context
vt analyze videos --project <slug> --product <slug>

# Examples:
vt analyze videos --project yakety-pack-instagram --product core-deck
vt analyze videos --project yakety-pack-instagram --product expansion-pack
```

### Without Product (Generic Analysis)
```bash
# Analyze without product adaptation
vt analyze videos --project <slug>

# Still captures all viral patterns, just no product-specific script
```

### Existing Commands Still Work
```bash
# Outlier detection
vt analyze outliers --project <slug>

# Video download
vt process videos --project <slug> --unprocessed-outliers

# Brand/product management
vt brand create --name "Brand Name"
vt product create --brand <slug> --name "Product Name"
vt product update --product <slug> --context-prompt "New context..."
```

## Product Context Management

### Current Structure

Products table includes:
- `name` - Product name

- `price_range` - Price point
- `key_problems_solved` - Problems it addresses
- `key_benefits` - Main benefits
- `features` - Product features
- `context_prompt` - Custom AI prompt for adaptations

### Example: Core Deck Context

```
