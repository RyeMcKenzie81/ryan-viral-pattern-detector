# Phase 8B: Advanced Intelligence — Implementation Checkpoint

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Branch:** `feat/ad-creator-v2-phase0`
**Commit:** `f2e6a05`
**Status:** Code complete — 63 new tests, 834 total passing, 0 regressions

## What Was Implemented

Phase 8B is the final intelligence phase, upgrading the scoring system from static weights to autonomously learned weights (Thompson Sampling), adding generation-level A/B testing (Mann-Whitney U), cross-brand knowledge transfer, competitive whitespace identification, visual style clustering (DBSCAN), and a full cold→warm→hot scorer weight transition.

### New Files (10)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `migrations/2026-02-16_ad_creator_v2_phase8b.sql` | 7 tables (scorer_weight_posteriors, selection_weight_snapshots, whitespace_candidates, generation_experiments, generation_experiment_runs, visual_style_clusters, visual_style_cluster_members) + brands.cross_brand_sharing column + partial unique index for max-1-active-experiment |
| `viraltracker/services/scorer_weight_learning_service.py` | Thompson Sampling on Beta(α,β) posteriors for all 8 scorer weights. Credit assignment from matured rewards. Cold→warm→hot phase transitions. Safety rails (floor 0.1, ceiling 2.0, max ±0.15 delta). Selection snapshot recording. |
| `viraltracker/services/generation_experiment_service.py` | 2-arm (control/variant) generation A/B testing. SHA-256 deterministic arm assignment. Mann-Whitney U with tie-corrected variance (pure Python, no scipy). Ad-level binary outcome analysis. |
| `viraltracker/services/whitespace_identification_service.py` | Competitive whitespace identification: cross-dimension pairwise combo scoring with novelty bonus (`0.15 * exp(-usage/3)`), synergy from interactions, filters (both scores > 0.5, usage < 5, no conflicts). Top 20 candidates. |
| `viraltracker/pipelines/ad_creation_v2/services/visual_clustering_service.py` | DBSCAN on cosine distance matrices of visual embeddings. Performance correlation (cluster → avg reward). Diversity check (cosine > 0.90 threshold). Pure Python DBSCAN implementation. |
| `tests/services/test_scorer_weight_learning.py` | 16 tests: credit assignment, phase transitions, blending formulas, safety rails, initialization |
| `tests/services/test_whitespace.py` | 10 tests: scoring, novelty bonus, filtering, advisory formatting |
| `tests/services/test_generation_experiments.py` | 14 tests: Mann-Whitney U with tie correction (binary heavy-tie data), deterministic assignment, metric aggregation, analysis workflow |
| `tests/services/test_cross_brand_transfer.py` | 11 tests: org scoping, opt-in enforcement, brand similarity (cosine), interaction transfer |
| `tests/services/test_visual_clustering.py` | 12 tests: DBSCAN output, centroid computation, performance correlation, diversity check |

### Modified Files (9)

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|

| `viraltracker/pipelines/ad_creation_v2/state.py` | +8 fields: selection transport (`selection_weights_used`, `selection_scorer_breakdown`, `selection_composite_score`, `selection_mode`) + experiment assignment (`experiment_seed`, `generation_experiment_id`, `generation_experiment_arm`, `generation_experiment_config`) |
| `viraltracker/pipelines/ad_creation_v2/orchestrator.py` | +4 params to `run_ad_creation_v2()` for selection transport, +experiment seed generation via `sha256(product_id:template_id:timestamp_minute)`, +arm assignment pre-graph |

| `viraltracker/ui/pages/21b_🎨_Ad_Creator_V2.py` | +`PHASE_8_SCORERS` import + explicit pass, +learned weights via `ScorerWeightLearningService` |
| `viraltracker/ui/pages/64_⚙️_Platform_Settings.py` | +3 tabs: Scorer Weights (per-scorer DataFrame + phase summary), Generation Experiments (list/activate/analyze/conclude), Visual Clusters (ranked DataFrame) |
| `viraltracker/ui/pages/02_🏢_Brand_Manager.py` | +Cross-brand sharing toggle (`st.toggle`) with save button |
| `tests/services/test_template_scoring_service.py` | Renamed `test_phase4_is_default` → `test_phase8_is_default`, updated assertions for 8 scorer keys |

### Test Results

- **834 tests** — all passing (63 Phase 8B new + 771 existing)
- **0 regressions** (scorer default test updated for PHASE_8 change)
- **3 pre-existing failures** (confirmed failing on clean HEAD `e6182db`, not caused by 8B)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Thompson Sampling**: Beta(α,β) posteriors per scorer per brand, same pattern as creative genome element scores
2. **Credit assignment**: contribution-weighted `W_i * S_i / Σ(W_j * S_j)`, high-contribution scorers get full α/β update, low get 0.3× soft update
3. **Cold→Warm→Hot transition**: 0-29 obs = static only, 30-99 = linear blend `α=(obs-30)/70`, 100+ = fully learned
4. **Safety rails**: floor 0.1 (no scorer zeroed), ceiling 2.0, max ±0.15 delta per weekly update
5. **Mann-Whitney U**: pure Python with tie-corrected variance `σ² = n_a*n_b/12 * (N+1 - Σ(t_k³-t_k)/(N*(N-1)))`, critical for binary approval data with many ties
6. **Ad-level analysis**: each ad is a binary outcome (approved=1, not=0), avoiding bias from varying run sizes
7. **2-arm model**: control/variant configs on experiment row (matching CHECKPOINT_002.md schema), not multi-arm table
8. **Max 1 active experiment per brand**: partial unique index `WHERE status = 'active'`
9. **SHA-256 deterministic assignment**: `hashlib.sha256()` not Python `hash()` (salt-randomized per process)
10. **Experiment seed**: `sha256(product_id:template_id:timestamp_minute)` for replay stability across retries
11. **Selection transport**: weights/scores passed as explicit params to `run_ad_creation_v2()` → state fields → CompileResultsNode records snapshot with `ad_run_id` (solving the "ad_run_id doesn't exist pre-graph" timing problem)
12. **Cross-brand transfer**: org-scoped, opt-in per brand (`brands.cross_brand_sharing` default FALSE), only statistical aggregates cross boundaries
13. **Brand similarity**: cosine similarity of element score mean vectors, cached in-memory (1hr TTL)
14. **Whitespace scoring**: `predicted_potential = mean(score_a, score_b) + synergy_bonus + novelty_bonus` where novelty = `0.15 * exp(-usage/3.0)`
15. **DBSCAN clustering**: pure Python on cosine distance matrix, eps=0.3, min_samples=3, cluster -1 = noise
16. **Non-fatal integration**: all new code in pipeline nodes and worker wrapped in try/except with warning logs

### P0/P1 Fixes Applied

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| P0-1 | Arm assignment uses ad_run_id before it exists | `experiment_seed` via `sha256(product_id:template_id:timestamp_minute)` pre-graph; record `ad_run_id` linkage in CompileResultsNode |
| P0-2 | Scorer default still PHASE_4_SCORERS | Changed default in `select_templates_with_fallback()` to `PHASE_8_SCORERS`; passed explicitly from scheduler + UI |
| P0-3 | Statistical method drift (Bayesian vs Mann-Whitney U) | Mann-Whitney U as specified in PLAN.md:1063; pure Python, no scipy |
| P0-3b | Multi-arm schema vs parent plan 2-arm | Simplified to control/variant matching CHECKPOINT_002.md schema |
| P0-4 | Style clustering missing from 8B scope | Added VisualClusteringService with DBSCAN as required by PLAN.md:1350 |
| P0-5 | Invalid SQL: UNIQUE WHERE inside CREATE TABLE | Separate `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... WHERE status='active'` |
| P0-6 | Python `hash()` salt-randomized per process | `hashlib.sha256().hexdigest()` → int → % 100 |
| P0-7 | Scorer-credit attribution data path unclear | Explicit transport: selection W_i/S_i as params → state → CompileResultsNode records snapshot |
| P1-1 | Human-override metrics counted too early | Override rate computed asynchronously in `run_analysis()` from `ad_review_overrides` |
| P1-2 | Active experiment cardinality undefined | Max 1 active via partial unique index + service validation |
| P1-4 | Statistical unit mismatch (per-run vs per-ad) | Ad-level binary analysis, not per-run summaries |

### Data Flow

```
Template selection → ScorerWeightLearningService.get_learned_weights() → effective weights
                  → select_templates_with_fallback(scorers=PHASE_8_SCORERS) → scores
                  → selection data threaded into run_ad_creation_v2() params → state

Pipeline runs → InitializeNode (ad_run_id created) → ... → CompileResultsNode
             → _record_selection_snapshot() → selection_weight_snapshots table
             → _record_experiment_outcome() → generation_experiment_runs table

Weekly genome_validation job →
  1. Existing: element scores, combo usage, interaction detection
  2. NEW: update_scorer_posteriors() → scorer_weight_posteriors (credit assignment)
  3. NEW: identify_whitespace() → whitespace_candidates (top 20)
  4. NEW: cluster_brand_styles() → visual_style_clusters + members
  5. NEW: correlate_with_performance() → avg_reward per cluster

Generation experiments →
  Orchestrator: sha256 seed → assign_arm() → state.generation_experiment_*
  CompileResultsNode: record_outcome() with ad_run_id
  Analysis: ad-level binary outcomes → Mann-Whitney U → winner/inconclusive
  Settings UI: create/activate/analyze/conclude

Cross-brand transfer →
  Brand requests priors → check cross_brand_sharing in same org
  → aggregate element_scores weighted by observations × similarity
  → apply CROSS_BRAND_SHRINKAGE = 0.3
  → fallback interaction effects from opted-in org peers
```

### Dependencies on Phase 8A

Phase 8B builds directly on Phase 8A infrastructure:
- `visual_embeddings` table → DBSCAN clustering input
- `element_interactions` table → whitespace synergy bonus source
- `element_combo_usage` table → whitespace usage count source
- `creative_element_rewards` table → credit assignment reward source
- `FatigueScorer` + `PHASE_8_SCORERS` → now the default (was opt-in in 8A)
- `InteractionDetectorService` → extended with cross-brand transfer
- `CreativeGenomeService.get_performance_context()` → extended with whitespace + cluster advisory
