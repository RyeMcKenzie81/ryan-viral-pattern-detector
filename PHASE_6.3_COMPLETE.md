## Top Performers

### Top 5 Highest Scoring Videos

| Rank | Score | Username | Views | Key Strengths |
|------|-------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | 81.1 | @ovonir.hvcbi.wfq | 414,990 | Perfect hook (100), Great story (95) |
| 2 | 77.5 | @wonderful.stories05 | 761,560 | Perfect hook (100), Excellent story (95) |
| 3 | 76.6 | @pet.wellness.daily | 573,009 | Strong visuals (90), Good hook (88) |
| 4 | 75.6 | @mr_finntastic | 157,643 | Balanced across all subscores |
| 5 | 75.1 | @holasoyrina3 | 187,517 | Great visuals (90), Good story (80) |

**Pattern:** High-scoring videos (75+) have:
- Hook scores of 85+
- Story scores of 80+
- Visuals scores of 85+
- Good algorithm optimization (90+)

### Lowest 5 Scoring Videos

| Rank | Score | Username | Views | Weak Areas |
|------|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 61.2 | @pau_pau034 | 348,171 | Low watchtime (35), Poor audio (47.5) |
| 2 | 64.4 | @thepaisareviews | 396,300 | Low engagement (40), Weak hook (70) |
| 3 | 73.0 | @emia_stef | 534,100 | Average across subscores |
| 4 | 73.2 | @holasoyrina3 | 515,109 | Low audio (47.5), Moderate engagement |
| 5 | 73.3 | @wichosdeals | 846,088 | Low watchtime (45), Weak engagement |

**Pattern:** Lower-scoring videos (60-70) have:
- Weak audio scores (all 47.5)
- Low watchtime estimates
- Mediocre engagement metrics
- **But still get good views!** (348K-846K)

**Interesting finding:** View count doesn't correlate strongly with overall score. Videos with scores in the 60s still achieve 300K+ views.

## Patterns & Recommendations

### Pattern 1: Hook + Story = Success
**Finding:** Videos with hook scores >85 AND story scores >85 consistently score 75+

**Recommendation:** Focus content creation on:
- First 3-5 seconds (hook optimization)
- Clear narrative structure (story beats)

### Pattern 2: Audio is Consistently Weak
**Finding:** ALL videos scored 47.5 on audio (default value)

**Root cause:** Data adapter doesn't have access to:
- Trending sound detection
- Original vs. licensed audio
- Beat sync analysis

**Recommendation:**
1. Integrate TikTok API for sound metadata
2. Add audio analysis to video_analyzer.py
3. Track trending sounds in separate table

### Pattern 3: Watchtime Estimates Unreliable
**Finding:** Watchtime scores all hover around 45-55

**Root cause:** Using engagement ratio as proxy (likes/views * 1000)

**Recommendation:**
1. Get actual TikTok Analytics data (requires API access)
2. Add manual entry for key videos
3. Use TikTok's Average Watch Time metric

### Pattern 4: Algorithm Optimization is Strong
**Finding:** Average algo score of 91.8 (highest subscore)

**Positive signals:**
- Proper hashtag counts (3-6)
- Good caption lengths
- Optimal posting times

**Recommendation:** Continue current hashtag/caption strategy

### Pattern 5: View Count ≠ Score
**Finding:** 61-score video has 348K views, while 81-score video has 415K views

**Interpretation:**
- Virality has external factors (timing, trends, luck)
- Score measures content quality, not viral potential
- Both quality AND external factors drive views

**Recommendation:**
- Use scores to optimize content quality
- Track external factors separately (trending sounds, challenges)

---

## Actionable Insights

### For Content Creators
1. **Prioritize hooks:** Invest time in first 3-5 seconds (highest impact)
2. **Use trending sounds:** Audio is weakest area, biggest opportunity
3. **Add engagement CTAs:** Boost comment/share rates
4. **Maintain current algo optimization:** Hashtags/captions are working

### For Scorer Improvement (v1.1.0)
1. **Add audio analysis:** Integrate trending sound detection
2. **Get real watch time data:** Replace proxy metrics
3. **Add external factors:** Track trending hashtags, challenges
4. **Adjust relatability weights:** May be overweighted (58.9 is low)

### For Future Analysis
1. **Time series:** Track how scores change over time
2. **Competitor comparison:** Score competitor videos
3. **A/B testing:** Score variations of same video concept
4. **ROI analysis:** Compare production cost to score/views

---

## Weight Adjustment Recommendations

### Current Weights (v1.0.0)
From `scorer/src/scoring/weights.ts`:
```typescript
hook: 0.20
story: 0.15
relatability: 0.10
visuals: 0.10
audio: 0.10
watchtime: 0.15
engagement: 0.10
shareability: 0.05
algo: 0.05
```

### Proposed Weights (v1.1.0)
Based on findings:
```typescript
hook: 0.20        // Keep (critical)
story: 0.15       // Keep (strong performance)
relatability: 0.08 // Reduce (low scores, may be overweighted)
visuals: 0.12     // Increase (strong performance, high impact)
audio: 0.12       // Increase (underutilized, high opportunity)
watchtime: 0.15   // Keep (need better data first)
engagement: 0.08  // Reduce (proxy for other factors)
shareability: 0.05 // Keep
algo: 0.05        // Keep (already optimized)
```

**Rationale:**
- Audio increased: Biggest opportunity area
- Visuals increased: Strong performance, correlates with success
- Relatability decreased: Lower scores suggest overweighting
- Engagement decreased: Already captured in other metrics

**Implementation:** See PHASE_6.4 for weight adjustment process

- Total time: ~7 seconds (~1s per video)

### Test 2: Export to CSV
```bash
vt score export --project wonder-paws-tiktok --output wonder-paws-scores.csv
```
**Result:** ✅ Success
- 14 rows exported
- All 19 columns present
- CSV valid and readable

### Test 3: Statistical Analysis
```bash
vt score analyze --project wonder-paws-tiktok
```
**Result:** ✅ Success
- All statistics calculated correctly
- Top/bottom 5 identified
- Distribution histogram generated

---

## Next Steps → Phase 6.4 (Optional)

**If weight adjustment desired:**
1. Update `scorer/src/scoring/weights.ts` with v1.1.0 weights
2. Bump version in `scorer/package.json` → 1.1.0
3. Rebuild scorer: `npm run build`
4. Re-score all videos: `vt score videos --project wonder-paws-tiktok --rescore`
5. Compare v1.0.0 vs v1.1.0 scores
6. Document changes in PHASE_6.4_COMPLETE.md

**If no adjustment:**
- Phase 6 complete! ✅
- Ready for production use
- Begin scoring additional projects
