I'm continuing work on the Facebook Ad Creation Agent for the viraltracker project.

**Read the checkpoint file first**:
/Users/ryemckenzie/projects/viraltracker/CHECKPOINT_PHASE6_STREAMLIT.md

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Phases 1-5 COMPLETE (database, tools, CLI, API, tests)
- ⏳ Phase 6 IN PROGRESS: Streamlit chat integration
- ✅ Foundational changes complete (ad_creation_agent exported and imported to orchestrator)
- ⏳ Next: Complete orchestrator integration and Streamlit UI

**Goal**:
Enable natural language ad creation in Streamlit chat:
"Create 5 ads for Wonder Paws Collagen 3x using this reference image [upload]"

**What to implement next**:
1. Update orchestrator system prompt to include ad creation agent description
2. Add route_to_ad_creation_agent routing tool to orchestrator
3. Add resolve_product_name tool for natural language product lookup
4. Add file upload capability to Streamlit chat interface
5. Implement rich result display for generated ads (image cards with status badges)
6. Test end-to-end natural language workflow

**Tech Stack**:
Python 3.11+, Pydantic-AI, Streamlit, FastAPI, Supabase, Claude, Gemini
