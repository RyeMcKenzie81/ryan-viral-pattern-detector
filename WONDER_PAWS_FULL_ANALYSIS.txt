═══ VIRAL FACTORS ═══

═══ WHY IT WENT VIRAL ═══
The video went viral because it combined an intriguing hook with an emotional story about a suffering animal. The use of suspense, by hinting at a shocking discovery, created a strong desire to see the second part. The call to action in the form of "Comment dog for part two" drove engagement in the comments section and generated conversation, pushing the video further into the algorithm's favour.

═══ IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS ═══
["Include real-time reactions or facial expressions from the 'doctors' for more visual engagement.","Use B-roll footage of the dog's active moments before the illness to contrast with its later state.","Add more emotional music to amplify key moments, especially during the description of the dog's pain.","Tease a small visual hint in the first few seconds as a faster attention grabber, like a blurred image of the extracted object.","Instead of asking to comment 'dog', perhaps use a more directed engagement phrase such as 'Wait for the surprise in Part 2!'"]

═══ WHY IT WENT VIRAL ═══
The video went viral due to the shocking hook promising disease reversal through simple foods, combined with the appeal of cute dogs.
